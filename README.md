Ensuring the banner, navigation bar, and search input scale correctly on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) might have been difficult.

Fixing layout shifts or overflow problems caused by large images or long text.

Navigation Bar Styling and Alignment

Aligning nav items (HOME, FACE, HAIR, etc.) evenly across the header.

Maintaining consistent padding and spacing across all screen sizes.

Carousel/Banner Integration

Implementing an auto-sliding banner with pause-on-hover or manual controls.

Making sure images don‚Äôt stretch or break layout.

Positioning text and CTAs ("BUY 1 GET 1 FREE") correctly on top of images.

Search Box Functionality

Making the search input and button work correctly across devices.

Positioning the search button icon inside the input field.

Performance Optimization

Optimizing image sizes to avoid slow loading times.

Lazy loading banners or limiting auto-play intervals.

üé® UI/UX Design Challenges
Visual Balance

Choosing a color palette that complements the brand (like green and teal for Mamaearth).

Avoiding clutter while displaying deals, timers, and CTAs effectively.

Brand Consistency

Reproducing brand-specific fonts, button styles, and banners.

Keeping header banners consistent with the rest of the site look and feel.

Call-To-Action (CTA) Placement

Making sure CTAs like ‚ÄúShop Now‚Äù are clearly visible and clickable.

Ensuring ‚ÄúGet Exclusive Offers‚Äù and coupon code areas stand out.

üß™ Testing Challenges
Cross-Browser Compatibility

Making sure the site looks the same on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari.

Localhost Differences

Loading assets (images, CSS, JavaScript) correctly from the local environment (127.0.0.1) could cause issues that won‚Äôt appear in production.
